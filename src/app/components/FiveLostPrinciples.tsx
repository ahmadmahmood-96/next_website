                        <p className="copy">Dear aspiring online entrepreneur,<br /><br />If you want to <strong>make your first $1,000 online and work your way up to the top 10%</strong>...<br /><br />Even if you&#x27;ve never made any money online before…<br /><br />And do so in record
                            time, without having to invest any money upfront or have any previous business experience…<br /><br />Then <span className="highlight">this will be the most important program you&#x27;ll ever watch.</span><br /><br />Here’s why:<br /><br />My
                            name is Iman Gadzhi and a few years ago <strong>I had nothing</strong>.<br /><br />I was living with my single mom and we were surviving off of government benefits…<br /><br />I had just jumped into the online business world, with a dream
                            to make it big online to get us out of that situation.<br /><br />I was 16 and had no one to guide me…<br /><br />It was also at that time that I decided to drop out of high school.<br /><br />I basically had all the odds stacked against me. <br /><br />I
                            went on to spend months trying to find the perfect online business model…<br /><br />Sales funnels.<br /><br />Dropshipping. <br /><br />Affiliate marketing.<br /><br />Online apps.<br /><br />You name it…<br /><br />I&#x27;ve <strong>tried them all, to no avail</strong>.<br /><br />All
                            I&#x27;d do was spend 12 to 16h every single day bumping my head against the wall trying to make this &quot;online business&quot; thing work…<br /><br />Only to get hit with a different blow every time.<br /><br />It was like that for
                            long months…<br /><br />Until I made a <strong>small yet extremely effective change</strong> to my approach…<br />‍</p>

                        all doing the exact same thing as I did, why only very few of them succeed?<br/>‍</p>

                    <p className="copy">‍<br/>And what I&#x27;ve discovered is this:<br/><br/>Most people think that they&#x27;re not succeeding because there&#x27;s some sort of <strong><em>&quot;secret information&quot;</em> they haven&#x27;t yet discovered</strong>…<br/><br/>Something
                        that they don&#x27;t know yet that, when they discover it...<br/><br/>...will lead them to success.<br/><br/>And they think that the lack of such &quot;knowledge&quot; is <strong>why they haven&#x27;t succeeded</strong>.<br/><br/>Maybe
                        you believe that yourself.<br/><br/>Now, the reality is:<br/><br/>That couldn&#x27;t be<strong> further from the truth</strong>. <br/><br/>For most of you, the reason you&#x27;re not succeeding is not because of what you&#x27;re <strong>NOT</strong>                        <strong>doing</strong>…<br/><br/>But because of what you <strong>ARE doing</strong>.<br/><br/>You see…<br/><br/>Most things that you ARE doing are keeping you stuck where you&#x27;re currently at. <br/><br/>And the truth is:<br/><br/>

                            className="highlight">‍<strong>You&#x27;re not at the top 10% because you&#x27;re doing things that keep you at the bottom</strong>.</span><br/><br/>And that&#x27;s extremely dangerous…<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because you keep doing the things that you THINK
                            are moving you forward…<br/><br/>When in reality they&#x27;re only moving you further and further away from your goals.<br/><br/>And the more you do them…<br/><br/>The further away you get.<br/><br/>Which means:<br/><br/>You need to
                            address those actions<strong> as soon as possible.<br/><br/>‍</strong>Because the more you wait, the harder it will be to fix them. <br/><br/>And that&#x27;s <strong>why I created Digital Launchpad</strong>...<br/>‍<br/>‍</p>
