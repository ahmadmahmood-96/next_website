                    <p className="copy"><br/>Here&#x27;s the thing…<br/><br/>The <strong>more people you help, the more money you make</strong>.<br/><br/>And since I want to make a lot of money with Educate…<br/><br/>I need to help <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> of people.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s
                        why Inside of Digital Launchpad you&#x27;re gonna get <span className="highlight">content more valuable than most people have inside their $2,000 programs</span>.<br/><br/>The truth is:<br/><br/>I have one of the largest audiences in the
                        online space…<br/><br/>And throughout my entire career I&#x27;ve focused on helping a <strong>very small fraction</strong> of this audience with my paid programs.<br/><br/>And I did that on purpose.<br/><br/>Because I take pride on my
                        programs holding the <strong>record for the best student results</strong> in the industry.<br/><br/>And if I want to keep this record...<br/><br/>I need to work with people that I know I can help.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s why my flagship
                        program, Agency Navigator, is priced at $1,500.<br/><br/>Because, realistically, if you haven&#x27;t made your first $1,500- you&#x27;ll struggle to go all the way from 0 to $10,000/month.<br/><br/>And to be completely transparent
                        with you…<br/><br/>Agency Navigator is where I <strong>really</strong> make money with Educate.<br/><br/>So if my objective is to make the most money…<br/><br/>I need to get as many people as possible to be able to afford these $1,500.<br/><br/>And
                        I know that for the vast majority of my audience, that price is beyond reach.<br/><br/>And that&#x27;s why I created Digital Launchpad.<br/><br/>Here&#x27;s the deal:<br/><br/>‍<strong>I don&#x27;t want to make ANY money with this program.<br/><br/>‍</strong>I
                        just want this to be accessible to <strong>EVERYONE…<br/><br/>‍</strong>So that as many people as possible can make their first $1,000 online and be able to afford Agency Navigator.<br/><br/>That&#x27;s my secret motive behind Digital
                        Launchpad.</p>
